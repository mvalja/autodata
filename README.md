# Automatic data collection and modeling project

IT architecture is constantly changing and data sources provide information that can deviate from reality to some degree. There can be problems with varying accuracy (e.g. actuality and coverage), representation (e.g. data syntax and file format), or inconsistent semantics. Integration of heterogeneous data from different sources needs to handle data quality problems of the sources. This can be done by using probabilistic models. 

This repository contains files from a project where we attempted to use truth discovery algorithms to reason over the validity of enterprise architecture data for the purpose of improving the accuracy of model. The pythons scripts of a prototype are given under the folder **framework**. Different information sources were used in the project and one of them, data from a SCADA small utility lab setup is given under the folder **labDATA**.
